# Mutual Fund Performance Prediction
This was my final year major project for prediction of mutual funds using data science on R and developing a web application using MEAN stack.

## Introduction
This project heavily depends upon the usage of R Language which is used for the purpose of Data Analysis of Mutual fund in order to depict it’s performance from past few years. The performance of Mutual Funds is been shown in the form of graphs been plotted using the various processes involved in Data Analysis. The results are been shown on our site which has been developed by our respective team members.

Initially the user has to create an account in order to access the site for checking out the performance of various Mutual Funds in the Finance market. In order to register the user has fill in details such as Name, email – id, contact number. Once the user has successfully created his/her account he would then be able to access the information and various data published regarding Mutual
Fund.

One key feature of our site is that the users have the right to share their queries based on their own studies and experiences.
Our main aim is to create user friendly and easy to access interface which can be used by all kinds of people. Kindly, please note that we do not intend to showcase or display any kind of false data or information through any means . Our team tried their very best to display best possible results.
